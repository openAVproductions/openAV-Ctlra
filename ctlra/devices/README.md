# Device specific info

## Native Instruments

### Maschine Mikro MK3

On device connect, screen gets redrawn in half black, half white. It indicates that device successfully initialized.
Od disconnect, whole screen goes black.

#### Known issues
Sometimes after pressing pads, first press on the button ( anything except pads ) is lost. From usb debugging looks like device doesn't send anything sometimes ( or maybe there is some error in usb handling somewhere ?)
